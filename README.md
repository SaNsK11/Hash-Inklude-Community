## Oh no! Lockdown again! Now without attending in person college how can I land my dream job in a FAANG company ?!

## Do you also sometimes feel like this?

### If you said YES, then my friend I am afraid you are totally misguided.

<p> Being locked indoors has surprisingly been a Great Learning Opportunity for me. I am only in my second year and I have learnt so much and that too for FREE! just by networking and following a simple approach of PROJECT BASED LEARNING. 
  
 <p> The most challenging part for me was finding out my niche. YES! Out of all the tasks the most challenging was figuring out what to learn!
 <p> The answer to this was learn SOMETHING about EVERYTHING. 
 
 #### During this year I've learnt so many tips and tricks and I don't wanna keep them to myself. I wanna share them with you all.
